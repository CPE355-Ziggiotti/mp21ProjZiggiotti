**Description of the Project**

This is an educational resource that tackles the different mapping techniques in cache memory. Cache memory is a technique in which computer applications temporarily store data in a
computer’s main memory (RAM) to enable fast retrievals of data. Caching is also useful to store
data calculations that are otherwise time-consuming to compute. The mapping functions are used
to map a particular block of main memory to a particular block of cache. The three mapping
techniques that are used in cache memory are direct, associative, set-associative mapping.
